Developed a machine learning model to predict the price of houses based on Kaggle House Price Prediction dataset.
Preprocessed and trained the dataset by implementing multiple linear regression using Scikit-learn and artificial neural
network using Keras.
Achieved an accuracy of 71% for the regression model and 84% for the neural network based model.
